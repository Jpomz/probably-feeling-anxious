General outline / notes

Predicting link probabilities in food webs across AMD gradient. 

Training data
-Individual pred + prey from Woodward
  - emailed to me, check gmail for date (I think it actually came from someone else)
-Individual predator / mean prey body size from Warburton
  - formulas are there, need to estimate dw
-Species average pred/prey from Thompson
  - I think I also have biomass data + weighted food webs from his international / logging study. Could add these to trainng set if needed. (need to look them up / redownload from exchange account)

AMD data
- 25 sites across AMD gradient
- Chemistry e.g. pH, metals
- Habitat measures (probably not important...)
- community composition / abundances
- Biomass estimates (all individuals)

1) "train" funciton
- use training data sets to get a likelihood of link presence based on pred / prey biomass
  - which data to use? 
  - look at how inferences / probability levels change based on combos of 3 data sets
    - Woodward individual
    - Warburton average
    - Thompson average 
    - looks like using all data is the best so far. Performs poorly for predicting fish prey. Need to revisit this
- "predict_niche_probability" function from Bartomeus
  - Fxn expands trait matching (name?) package
  - emailed to me while I was in OR (check gmail account, May or June???)

2) Estimate link probability / strength in AMD streams
- link probability, Aij ~ J x N
  - J = Niche, based on body size rules
  - N = Neutral, product of relative abundances
  - rescale Aij [0,1]
- use species averages? 
  - need to do some data cleaning
  - e.g. marry biomass estimates to community composotion data (e.g. surber samples)
  - mean abundance, biomass, etc
- use probability as proxy of intxn strength?
- modify probability with relative abundances?
- multiple runs with binary links (based on probability above), and interaction strength based on biomass relationship?
- Use Julia package and assess food webs with link probabilities?

3a) stability?
- Tang / Allesina (2012, 2014(?))
- stability based on their metric
- need to calculate both "+" and "-" interactions, eigen values, etc

3b) stability?
- Dunne 2002
- random species deletions
- delete species based on size probability (bigger = higher probability)

3c) stability with probabilistic networks?
- run N bernouli trials using estimated probabilities. 
- calculate food web measures (mean, sd) from bernouli trials
- calculate stability for each trial, get a distribution of stability measures (e.g. Tang)
  - interaction strengths based on allometric / metabolic scaling (in order to get both the + and - interaction strengths)

3d) "inferred" stability
- distribution of link strengths (viz a viz interaction probabilities)
- many weak, few strong
- other measures?
